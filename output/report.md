### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 81,971.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,441.89 / 92,912.78 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 81,971.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 76,500.11, then a later completed retest and rejection | 71,029.22 / 65,558.33 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 76,500.11 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: the 4H close held above 76500 and price remains higher. Bias stays neutral with mild upside tilt; latest action confirms the lower pivot as support but 81971 still caps, so range-bound holds. Key levels are 76500 support and 81971 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 76500 would invalidate the tilt and revive bearish risk.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price stayed above 2293.44, so neutral-to-bullish still fits. Latest 4H close 2303.6 and quote 2327.43 are above lower pivot but well below upper 2391.55, leaving upside unconfirmed and no new signal. Key levels: 2293.44 support/invalidation, 2391.55 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2293.44 negates the upside tilt.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains above the upper pivot but confirmation is still absent. Bias stays neutral-to-firm; the latest 4H close at 4022.635 was below 4037.805 while the current quote at 4042.67 holds above it, so an unconfirmed upside breakout attempt persists. Watch 4037.805 as the pivot and 3964.205 as support. Risk: a rejection back below 4037.805 invalidates the firming view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read held: price remains inside the pivots and below the upper level. Updated bias is neutral/range; the latest 4H close edged up but the current quote slipped back between pivots, so no breakout confirmation. Key levels: 94.623 support, 99.924 resistance. Risk: a sustained close outside that range, especially above 99.924, would invalidate the range view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was mostly right: the 4H close stayed below 7580.2, but price has pressed to the 7655.6 pivot. Bias remains bearish with mixed momentum: latest 4H close improved yet remains under 7580.2, and quote is just below 7655.6. Key levels: 7655.6 overhead, then 7731.0; 7580.2 and 7504.8 support. Risk: a sustained reclaim of 7655.6 invalidates the bearish view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
