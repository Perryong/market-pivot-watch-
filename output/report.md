| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral/range read was right: price remains between frozen pivots. Bias stays neutral/range. Latest 4H close 83370 and quote 83953 hold above lower pivot 82875 but below upper 84942; bounce lacks breakout. Key levels: 82875 support, 84942 resistance. Risk: 4H close below 82875 or above 84942 would shift the range bias.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH held above 2646 and closed higher. Bias stays bullish-leaning while above 2646; latest 4H close and current quote above pivot keep the setup intact, but retest remains unconfirmed and 1H still says wait. Key levels: 2646 support/invalidation, upside 2855 then 3064, lower 2436. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 flips the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 92.25 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous cautious-bullish read was right: price has not confirmed above the pivot. Completed 4H still bullish, but latest close slipped and quote sits just under 95.80, so momentum lacks confirmation. Key levels: 95.80 pivot, 99.35 upside target, 92.25 lower pivot. Risk: sustained trade below 95.80 keeps pressure on 92.25; a break there invalidates bullish bias and opens bearish targets.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was broadly right: the 4H close held below 7731 and price is still capped. Bias is neutral/range-bound. The latest 4H close at 7695.5 softened, while the current quote at 7714.35 rebounds toward the upper pivot but has not broken it. Key levels: 7731 resistance, 7655.6 support. Risk: a sustained 4H close above 7731 would invalidate the neutral view; rejection there keeps range pressure.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
