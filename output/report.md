### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was mostly right: 4H close is above 82874.93 but quote is below it. Bias stays neutral/indecisive. The marginal close above the lower pivot softens the bearish case, yet quote back under it means no confirmation. Key levels: 82874.93, then 84942.45 above; 80807.41 then 78739.89 below. Risk: a sustained close above 82874.93 invalidates the bearish lean; rejection keeps it alive.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: no breakout, still range-bound below 2527.57. Latest 4H close 2497.42 is a marginal higher nudge but remains mid-range; bias soft bearish/range. Key resistance 2527.57 then 2587.28; support 2467.86 then 2408.15. Risk: a 4H close above 2527.57 invalidates bearish lean; losing 2467.86 confirms breakdown.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
