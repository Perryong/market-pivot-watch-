### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 81,971.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,441.89 / 92,912.78 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 81,971.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 76,500.11, then a later completed retest and rejection | 71,029.22 / 65,558.33 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 76,500.11 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was broadly right: the neutral range call still holds. Updated view: neutral-to-soft bearish within the frozen range, with latest 4H close and quote drifting lower toward the lower pivot. Key levels are 76500 support and 81971 resistance. Risk: a decisive break below support would shift bias bearish; a recovery through resistance invalidates the drift.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 2,391.55, then a later completed retest and hold | 2,489.66 / 2,587.77 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 2,391.55 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 2,293.44, then a later completed retest and rejection | 2,195.33 / 2,097.22 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 2,293.44 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-02 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 2,293.44.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-11-02 12:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price remains below 2293.44 and no new signal fired. Bias stays bearish; latest 4H close 2254.18 and quote 2253.08 are below the lower pivot, so weakness persists without fresh confirmation. Key level 2293.44; upper pivot 2391.55 is secondary; bearish target zone near 2195.33. Risk: completed 4H close above 2293.44 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
