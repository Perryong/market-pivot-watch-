### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 76,200.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 78,890.00 / 81,580.00 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 76,200.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 73,510.00, then a later completed retest and rejection | 70,820.00 / 68,130.00 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read held: price stayed above 73510 and inside the range, with no signal. Updated view: neutral-to-mildly constructive; latest 4H close 74395 and quote 74316 firm above 73510 but remain below 76200, so range-bound. Key levels: 73510 support, 76200 resistance, 70820 downside pivot. Risk: a completed 4H close below 73510 invalidates the constructive lean.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price stayed above 2060 and no confirmation appeared. Updated read: bias is neutral-to-bullish above 2060, but quote 2072.07 has slipped toward the pivot while latest 4H close 2078.39 keeps it above. Key levels: 2060 support/pivot, 2246 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2060 invalidates the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
