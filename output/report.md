### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 82,060.88, then a later completed retest and hold | 83,670.58 / 85,280.28 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 82,060.88 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 80,451.18, then a later completed retest and rejection | 78,841.48 / 77,231.78 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 80,451.18 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was wrong: the latest completed 4H close is above the lower pivot. Bias is neutral-to-bearish; the reclaim of 80451.18 weakens downside momentum, but price is still capped below 82060.88 and no new signal is active. Key levels: 80451.18, 82060.88, downside 78841.48. Risk: a completed 4H close above 82060.88 invalidates the bearish/range view; losing 80451.18 restores downside pressure.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right on range, but bearish follow-through is unconfirmed. Bias bearish/corrective: 4H close 2339.62 and quote 2345.04 remain below 2351.55 but above 2285.33, so no new signal; wait for confirmation. Key levels: 2351.55 invalidation, 2285.33 then 2219.11 downside, 2417.77 above. Risk: 4H close above 2351.55 invalidates; holding above 2285.33 may delay pressure.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
