| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right on no signal/range-bound, though the close firmed further inside the range. Bias stays neutral-to-mildly constructive: price holds above 73510 and grinds toward 76200 without a confirmed breakout. Key levels are 73510 support, 76200 resistance, and 70820 downside pivot. Risk: a completed 4H close below 73510 invalidates the lean.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price held above 2060 and confirmation stayed absent. Bias remains neutral-to-bullish while above the 2060 pivot; latest 4H close 2078.39 and quote 2080.24 are above it, but price is still far from 2246 resistance and no setup is active. Key levels: 2060 support/pivot, 2246 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2060 invalidates the view and revives bearish risk.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: no confirmation, price remains between pivots and softer near support. Latest 4H close eased but held above lower pivot, so bias stays neutral-to-soft. Key levels: 4037.805 upper, 3964.205 lower/support. Risk: gap whipsaw; a completed 4H close below support confirms downside, above upper neutralizes soft bias.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

- SELL at 2026-11-11 20:00:00 UTC, close 86.75

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right until the latest completed 4H close broke below 88.031. Bias is now bearish: completed close 86.75 sits below lower pivot 88.031, while current quote is nearby and no retest is confirmed. Key level is 88.031 resistance/invalidation; bearish targets 77.87 and 67.71 matter. Risk: a completed 4H close back above 88.031 would invalidate the bearish view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: support held and mild firmness persisted without a breakout. Bias stays neutral-to-firm; latest 4H close 7633.4 and quote 7629.45 sit above 7494-7515 support but below 7718.4, so no confirmation. Key levels: 7494-7515 support, 7718.4 breakout threshold. Risk: rejection at 7718.4 keeps range tone; a 4H close below 7494 invalidates the firm tone.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
