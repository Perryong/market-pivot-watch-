### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: range held, no breakout, neutral bias intact. Latest 4H close 84116.8 and quote 84100.77 remain above midpoint ~83909 but below upper 84942, so action is still range-bound with mild upper-half drift. Key levels: midpoint ~83909, upper 84942, lower 82875. Risk: whipsaw; sustained 4H close below midpoint or outside either pivot invalidates neutral view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 2,646.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 2,855.11 / 3,064.22 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 2,646.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 2,436.89, then a later completed retest and rejection | 2,227.78 / 2,018.67 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 2,436.89 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 04:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 2,646.00.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-23 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH is still above 2646, with no fresh breakout confirmation. Latest 4H close 2691.16 and quote 2690.48 hold above upper pivot 2646, so bias stays constructive but stalled; 1H still waits. Key levels: 2646 invalidation, 2436.89 support, upside 2855.11 then 3064.22. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 flips bias.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
