### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 87,282.81, then a later completed retest and hold | 89,134.54 / 90,986.27 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 87,282.81 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 85,431.08, then a later completed retest and rejection | 83,579.35 / 81,727.62 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 85,431.08 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price still sits between 83579 and 85431, flat and unconfirmed. Bias stays bearish but unconfirmed; latest 4H close is marginally lower and quote just above it, so action is corrective/sideways inside range. Key levels: 85431 invalidation, 83579 bearish


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 12:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 81,741.00.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: 4H still has not confirmed a breakout above 84412/84418, with closes pinned just under it and price above 81741. Bias stays modestly bullish but unconfirmed/consolidating; latest quote at 84418.85 is only marginal. Key levels: 84412/84418, then 86265; invalidation remains a completed 4H close below 81741. Risk: rejection at the pivot cluster keeps it rangebound.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-21 08:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH held 2646.55 and no new signal fired. Bias remains bullish above 2646.55. Latest 4H close 2687.28 vs prior 2696.20 and quote 2684.25 show retest/consolidation above pivot, no fresh breakout. Watch 2646.55 support/invalidation, 2858.50 then 3070.45 upside, 2434.60 lower. Risk: completed 4H close below 2646.55 flips the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-23 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH still holds above 2646, though the latest 4H close eased. Bias remains constructive but momentum cools and 1H still waits. Price is just over pivot 2646; holding it keeps structure intact, with upside markers at 2855 and 3064. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 invalidates, and without a fresh breakout, chop persists.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral call was right: price held above lower pivot and below upper, no confirmation. Bias still neutral. Latest 4H close 4265.14 stays above 4261.375 but eased; current quote near 4292 shows intraday bounce, still below 4341.135. Key levels: 4261.375 support, 4341.135 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 4261.375 would weaken recovery and favor bearish side.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Read was broadly right: price stayed above 95.798 and pullback continued. Bias stays cautiously bullish while above frozen 95.798, but quote 96.782 and last 4H close 97.48 keep momentum soft and no retest confirmed. Key levels: 95.798 invalidation; upside 99.348 then 102.898; below 95.798 opens 92.248/88.698. Risk: failed retest or completed 4H close below 95.798 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
