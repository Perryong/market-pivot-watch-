| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 76,500.11 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-05 16:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 76,500.11.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right on bearish bias; price is now below 76500 rather than retesting it. Bias stays bearish: the latest completed 4H close and live quote are below the pivot, so the breakdown still lacks a confirmed retest. Key levels: 76500 invalidation/resistance, 71029 then 65558 bearish targets, 81971 upper. Risk: a completed 4H close above 76500 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Prior read was right: the completed 4H close at 2252.7 confirmed bearish structure below both pivots. Bias stays bearish; latest close and quote are below 2293.44, with no retest confirmed. Key levels: 2293.44 overhead invalidation, 2391.55 major cap, downside 2195.33 then 2097.22. Risk: a completed 4H close above 2293.44 invalidates the bearish view.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price remains firm but inside the range. Bias stays neutral; the latest 4H close and quote sit between the frozen pivots, showing drift toward the upper half without acceptance beyond either. Key levels: 88.031 and 98.192. Risk: a completed 4H close below 88.031 revives the bearish case; sustained acceptance above 98.192 invalidates neutral.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-05 16:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 7,655.60.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

The prior read was right: the bearish break persisted and price is still extended below the lower pivot. Bias remains bearish; the latest 4H close at 7447.4 is well below 7655.6 and beneath 7580.2/7504.8 with no retest. Key levels: 7655.6 invalidation, then 7731.0; 7580.2/7504.8 as broken markers. Risk: a completed 4H close above 7655.6 would invalidate the bearish view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
