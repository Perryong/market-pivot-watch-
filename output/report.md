| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 76,500.11 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read remains right: BTC is still above 76500 and range-bound between pivots with a mild upward tilt. Bias is neutral; the latest 4H close and quote are inside 76500-81971, so no breakout is confirmed. Key levels: 76500 support, 81971 resistance. Risk: a decisive break below 76500 shifts bearish; reclaiming 81971 invalidates neutral.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was wrong: 4H close 2299.41 is above 2293.44, invalidating bearish bias. Bias is now neutral/constructive; price at 2291.7 has slipped below the pivot, so reclaim is unconfirmed. Watch 2293.44 and 2391.55 upside; 2195.33 downside. Risk: a completed 4H close back below 2293.44.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior read was broadly right: 3964.205 still caps and no downside break, but the rebound weakens the bearish case. Latest 4H close 3936.435 remains below the frozen pivot, so bias is mildly bearish/rangebound; quote 3933.215 sits mid-range. Key refs: resistance 3964.205, supports 3890.605 then 3817.005. Risk: a 4H close above 3964.205 invalidates bearish bias.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |

| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 103.19, then a later completed retest and hold | 106.65 / 110.11 |

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 99.74 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-02 16:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 99.74.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-11-03 08:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: the completed 4H close at 96.795 confirms bearish follow-through below 99.738. Bias stays bearish; price is pressing toward bearish target 96.282 after rejecting the pivot zone. Key levels: 96.282 then 92.826 below; 99.738 invalidation. Risk: a completed 4H close above 99.738 neutralizes; holding above 96.282 could mean consolidation rather than fresh breakdown.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was partly wrong: latest 4H close reclaimed 7580.2, weakening the bearish call. Bias is now neutral-to-cautious bearish: price sits just above 7580.2 but remains well below 7655.6, so the bounce lacks confirmation. Watch 7580.2 as support and 7655.6 as resistance; losing 7580.2 revives bearish pressure, while clearing 7655.6 invalidates it. 7504.8 is deeper support.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
