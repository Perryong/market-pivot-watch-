### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 76,200.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 78,890.00 / 81,580.00 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 76,200.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 73,510.00, then a later completed retest and rejection | 70,820.00 / 68,130.00 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price stayed below 76200 and rangebound. Updated: bias remains mildly bearish but unconfirmed; latest 4H close 74372 and quote near 74805 keep price inside 73510-76200, with recovery still below the upper pivot. Watch 73510 support and 76200 invalidation. Risk: a 4H close above 76200 would flip the view bullish.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH remains rangebound with no confirmation. Bias stays neutral/slightly bearish; the modest bounce above the 2113.3 4H close is not breakout confirmation and price is still in the lower half below 2246. Key levels: 2060 support, 2246 resistance. Risk is range whipsaw; a 4H close above 2246 invalidates the lean, while losing 2060 weakens the floor.

### AI analysis

Mostly right: cautious-bullish held, though the tentative breakout has extended while the 4H close remains below 4111.4. Bias stays cautious-bullish; price is clearly above 4111.4 but confirmation is incomplete. Key levels: 4111.4 pivot/target, 4037.8 support. Risk: a close back below 4111.4 weakens the breakout; loss of 4037.8 invalidates the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right: no pivot break and price remains above the lower level. Bias remains neutral; latest 4H close fell to 89.235 and the quote at 88.114 sits just above the 88.031 lower pivot, so pressure is bearish-leaning but unconfirmed. Key levels are 88.031 and 98.192. Risk: ATR unavailable weakens confirmation; sustained trade outside that range invalidates neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price stayed above 7367.1 and remained range-bound. Updated read: neutral; latest 4H close 7425.2 and quote 7440.2 are firmer but still well inside 7367.1-7718.4, so no breakout confirmation. Key levels: 7367.1 and 7718.4. Risk: a sustained close below 7367.1 would invalidate neutral and shift bias bearish.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
