### Trade levels — conditional plans

|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 76,200.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 78,890.00 / 81,580.00 |

| Short entry | New 4H cross below 73,510.00, then a later completed retest and rejection | 70,820.00 / 68,130.00 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior read was broadly right: price held below 76200 and stayed rangebound. Updated: bias remains mildly bearish but unconfirmed; latest 4H close at 74372 and quote near 74866 show a modest recovery inside the 73510-76200 range, still below the upper pivot and around midpoint. Key levels: 73510 support, 76200 invalidation. Risk: a completed 4H close above 76200 would flip the view bullish.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was largely right: ETH stayed rangebound, though the higher 4H close softens the bearish lean. Bias is neutral/slightly bearish; 2113.30 is above 2094.01 but still lower-half below 2246. No confirmation yet. Watch 2060 support and 2246 resistance. Risk is range whipsaw; losing 2060 weakens the floor, while a 4H close above 2246 invalidates the lean.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

### AI analysis

Partly right: support held and bias stayed cautious-bullish, but quote is now above 4111.4. Bias remains cautious-bullish; latest 4H close is below 4111.4 while price is just above it, a tentative breakout. Key levels: 4111.4 immediate pivot/target, 4037.8 support. Risk: closing back below 4111.4 weakens confirmation; sustained loss of 4037.8 invalidates the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right: price softened again but stayed above the lower pivot with no confirmed breakout. Bias remains neutral; latest 4H close fell and the quote sits nearer 88.031 but still above it, so no pivot break. Key levels are 88.031 and 98.192. Risk: ATR unavailable weakens confirmation; sustained trade outside that range would invalidate neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price held above 7367.1 and stayed range-bound. Updated read: neutral; latest 4H close 7425.2 is firmer but still inside 7367.1-7718.4, so no breakout confirmation. Key levels: 7367.1 and 7718.4. Risk: sustained close below 7367.1 would invalidate neutral and shift bias bearish.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
