### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 82,060.88, then a later completed retest and hold | 83,670.58 / 85,280.28 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 82,060.88 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 80,451.18, then a later completed retest and rejection | 78,841.48 / 77,231.78 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 80,451.18 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior read was right: no break was confirmed then, and still none is. Updated read: neutral/range bias; latest completed 4H close held above 80451.18, but current quote is below it, so bearish shift remains unconfirmed. Key levels: 80451.18 and 82060.88. Risk: a completed 4H close below 80451.18 restores bearish pressure; above 82060.88 invalidates the range view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 2,417.77, then a later completed retest and hold | 2,483.99 / 2,550.21 |

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 2,351.55 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-10-25 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 2,351.55.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH stayed below 2351.55 and weakened. Bias remains bearish; latest 4H close 2347.99 kept price under failed support, and current quote is lower. Watch 2351.55 as resistance/invalidation and 2417.77 as upside trigger; downside pivots are 2285.33/2219.11. Risk: a completed 4H close above 2351.55 would invalidate the bearish view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
