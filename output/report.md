### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 76,200.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 78,890.00 / 81,580.00 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 76,200.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 73,510.00, then a later completed retest and rejection | 70,820.00 / 68,130.00 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: 73510 held and downside remains unconfirmed. Bias stays neutral; latest 4H closed softer but still inside pivots and above lower. Key levels: 73510 support, 76200 upper invalidation. A 4H close below 73510 would confirm downside risk; reclaiming 76200 would neutralize it. Main risk is range whipsaw before confirmation.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior neutral range read remains correct. ETH is still neutral inside 2060-2246; latest 4H close 2114.7 and quote 2123.65 show chop below the ~2153 divider, so no breakout confirmation. Key levels are 2060, 2246, and ~2153. Risk is range whipsaw/false breakout; a 4H close outside 2060-2246 invalidates neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: the 4H close slipped below 4111.4, weakening momentum as flagged. Bias remains constructive but unconfirmed; latest close sits just under that pivot and price is hovering around it. Key levels: 4111.4 for confirmation, 4185 upside reference, 4037.8 invalidation. Risk: another 4H close below 4111.4 or loss of 4037.8 undermines the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 98.19, then a later completed retest and hold | 108.35 / 118.51 |

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-09 20:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 88.03.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price remains below 88.031 and the latest 4H close kept the bearish sequence intact. Bias stays bearish; 4H closes at 87.037 then 86.409 with quote near 86.511 show continued rejection under the frozen pivot and no reclaim. Key level is 88.031; a completed 4H close above it invalidates the bearish view. Risk is a pivot reclaim before downside confirmation.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price remains inside the frozen pivots and neutral chop persists. Bias stays neutral; the latest 4H close slipped modestly but is still mid-range, with no confirmed breakout or active setup. Key levels are lower 7367.1 and upper 7718.4. Risk: range chop/false moves; a decisive 4H close outside either pivot would invalidate neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
