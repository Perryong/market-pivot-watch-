| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was broadly right: range held and no breakout, though price firmed toward the upper pivot. Bias stays mildly bearish but unconfirmed; latest action is upward drift inside 73510-76200 and still below 76200, so no breakout signal. Watch 73510 support and 76200 invalidation. Risk: a 4H close above 76200 would flip the view bullish.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read remains correct: still rangebound with no confirmation. Bias neutral/slightly bearish; latest 4H close 2113.3 keeps ETH in lower half between 2060 support and 2246 resistance despite quote near 2134. No tracked setup, so action is wait. Risk is range whipsaw: a 4H close above 2246 invalidates the lean, while losing 2060 weakens the floor.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: cautious-bullish tone held but confirmation stayed incomplete. Latest 4H close 4108.51 sits below the 4111.4 pivot/target while quote is above it, so bias stays cautiously bullish but breakout confirmation is lacking. Key levels: 4111.4 pivot/target, 4185 upside target, 4037.8 support. Risk: a completed close below 4111.4 weakens the view; loss of 4037.8 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous bearish breakdown read was early: price is back above 88.031. Bias is neutral; latest 4H close 89.235 sits above the lower pivot but still below 90.801, so no confirmed reversal. Watch 88.031: losing it revives bearish risk, holding keeps range/neutral. Upper 98.192 is distant. Risk: a decisive close below 88.031 would confirm breakdown; no new signal, wait.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right: price remains inside 7367.1-7718.4. Updated read: neutral; latest 4H close 7425.2 stays range-bound while quote 7518.45 is firmer but still lacks breakout confirmation. Key levels: 7367.1 and 7718.4. Risk: a sustained 4H close outside that range would invalidate neutral and shift bias.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
