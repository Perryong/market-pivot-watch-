### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right: price remains inside the frozen range, still near lower pivot. Bias stays neutral. Latest 4H close 83434.57 and quote 83257.22 are between lower 82874.93 and upper 84942.45, though quote sits closer to lower. Key levels: lower 82874.93, upper 84942.45. Risk: a completed 4H close below lower would turn bearish; above upper would invalidate neutral.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: 4H close stayed above 2504.26 and quote has now recovered above it. Bias remains neutral; price is holding just above lower pivot but lacks upside confirmation. Key levels: 2504.26, 2579.88, 2428.64. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2504.26 revives bearish pressure; acceptance above 2579.88 favors bulls.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 4,140.77 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains above 4140.775 despite softer closes. Latest 4H close near 4159 is still above the lower pivot but below upper 4300, so bias stays neutral-to-soft. Key levels: 4140.775 support, 4300.395 resistance. Risk: a confirmed 4H close below 4140.775 would invalidate the neutral view and turn bias bearish.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 93.28, then a later completed retest and hold | 96.45 / 99.62 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 93.28 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 90.11, then a later completed retest and rejection | 86.95 / 83.78 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 90.11 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-10-13 12:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 93.28.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-10-13 16:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous cautious bullish read was right: price remains above 93.283 and closed 95.08. Bias stays cautiously bullish; quote 95.383 holds above the upper pivot, but setup waits as price is too far. Key levels: 93.283 pivot/invalidation, 90.115 support; upside refs 96.451 and 99.619. Risk: stretched move may pull back; completed 4H close below 93.283 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was mostly right: quote is above 7806.4 while completed 4H close remains below it. Bias stays mildly bullish above 7731; latest quote 7818.25 reclaims T1 but the 7801.0 close still lacks confirmation. Watch 7806.4 pivot, 7731 support, 7881.8 upside. Risk: a 4H close back below 7806.4 would weaken the reclaim; below 7731 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
