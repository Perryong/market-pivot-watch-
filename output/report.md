### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains inside pivots and no breakout confirmed. Bias stays neutral; latest 4H close 83796.01 is below midpoint, while quote 83984 has edged above midpoint but stays below upper. Key levels: upper 84942.45, lower 82874.93. Risk: false break or whipsaw near either edge; sustained close outside invalidates neutral.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 04:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 2,646.00.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-23 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH still holds above 2646 and the pullback remains mild, not a reversal. Bias stays constructive but confirmation lags; price is above the upper pivot, latest 4H close 2686.9. Watch 2646 as invalidation, then 2855.11 and 3064.22 for confirmation. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 flips the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right: price is still inside the frozen pivot range. Bias remains neutral; latest 4H close 4291.285 and quote 4288.17 sit above lower 4261.375 and below upper 4341.135, showing mild downward drift but no breakout. Key levels remain 4261.375 and 4341.135. Risk: a completed 4H close outside that range would invalidate neutral; otherwise wait.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 95.80, then a later completed retest and hold | 99.35 / 102.90 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 95.80 after a bullish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-24 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 95.80.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-25 08:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Prior read remains broadly correct: completed 4H still holds above 95.798 while spot is below it. Bias stays cautiously bullish, but latest action is retest pressure, not fresh confirmation. Key levels: 95.798 must hold on a completed 4H basis; below it, 92.248 support; upside targets 99.348 then 102.898. Risk: a completed 4H close below 95.798 invalidates the bullish setup.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Last read was broadly right: price held above 7731 but confirmation stayed absent. Bias cautiously bullish while latest 4H close 7737.9 sits above 7731; quote 7751.15 keeps breakout alive, but no new signal means follow-through is still weak. Key levels: 7731 then 7655.6; upside references 7806.4 and 7881.8. Risk: a 4H close back below 7731 invalidates; losing 7655.6 shifts risk lower.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
