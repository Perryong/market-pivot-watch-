### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 76,200.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 78,890.00 / 81,580.00 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 76,200.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 73,510.00, then a later completed retest and rejection | 70,820.00 / 68,130.00 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price and latest completed 4H close remain above 73510, so the constructive range-bound lean held. Bias stays mildly constructive but range-bound; latest close/quote sit just above lower pivot and far below 76200 with no new signal. Watch 73510 support/pivot, 76200 cap, 70820 downside. Risk: a completed 4H close below 73510 would invalidate the constructive lean.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior read remains right: price still holds above 2060 and no new signal. Bias is neutral-to-mildly bullish but unconfirmed; latest 4H close 2062.76 and quote 2063.83 sit just above the 2060 pivot, showing limited conviction. Key levels: 2060 support, then 2246 upper. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2060 would invalidate the reclaim and restore bearish pressure.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 3,964.20 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-11-11 00:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 4,037.80.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-11-11 04:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains above the pivot and the retest held. Bias stays cautiously bullish; latest 4H close and quote are above 4037.805, but no new signal and the 1H entry says wait due to a data-session gap. Key levels: 4037.805 pivot/invalidation, 3964.205 lower, upside targets 4111.405/4185.005. Risk: gap-driven false breakout; a completed 4H close below 4037.805 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-09 20:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 88.03.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price stayed below 88.031, no retest, bearish bias intact. Latest 4H close 87.169 and quote 86.728 show the bounce fading under the lower pivot; completed-candle state remains bearish with no new signal. Key level is 88.031; below it, bearish targets dominate, with 98.192 far above. Risk: a completed 4H close above 88.031 invalidates the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: support held and price firmed again. Bias stays neutral-to-firm; latest 4H close at 7572 is above the 7494-7515 area but below 7718.4, with no confirmed setup and 1H still invalidated. Watch 7494-7515 support and 7718.4 breakout threshold. Risk: a 4H close below 7494 would weaken the firm tone.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
