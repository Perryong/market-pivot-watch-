### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 87,282.81, then a later completed retest and hold | 89,134.54 / 90,986.27 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 87,282.81 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 85,431.08, then a later completed retest and rejection | 83,579.35 / 81,727.62 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 85,431.08 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: lower 4H close, quote still below 85431. Bias stays mildly bearish but unresolved. Latest 4H closed 84023.5; current quote above it yet below 85431 and above 83579. Watch 83579 for downside confirmation; 85431 invalidates. Risk: a 4H close above 85431 neutralizes the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 12:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 81,741.00.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: no completed breakout held and price remains above 81741, though quote is now pushing through 84412/84418. Bias stays modestly bullish but unconfirmed because latest 4H close 84044 sits below the short-term cap. Key levels: 84412/84418, then 86265; 81741 is invalidation. Risk: another failed push and a completed 4H close below 81741.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-21 08:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH stayed above 2646.55 and no new signal fired. Bias remains bullish above the frozen pivot, but latest 4H close at 2672.23 is still soft consolidation; current quote 2712.0 shows mild recovery. Key levels: 2646.55 invalidation, upside 2858.50 then 3070.45, lower 2434.60. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646.55 flips the view.

### AI analysis

Last read was right: ETH held above 2646 with no new signal, and quote has firmed to 2712. Bias remains constructive but unconfirmed. Latest 4H close at 2672 was soft versus prior, yet price sits above pivot after retest, so consolidation. Key levels: 2646 invalidation, 2855 then 3064 for confirmation. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 flips the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral read was right: price remains between pivots, holding above lower support. Latest 4H close and quote are firmer but still below upper pivot, so bias stays neutral; no breakout confirmation. Key levels: 4261.4 support, 4341.1 resistance. Risk: a 4H close below support would turn bearish; above resistance invalidates neutrality. No signal, wait.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Prior read remains right: price held above 95.798 and stayed under 97.48. Updated: bias cautiously bullish but unconfirmed. Latest 4H close 97.02 is above 95.798, yet quote 96.2285 has eased back toward the pivot, so follow-through is still weak. Key levels: 95.798 invalidation; upside 99.348 then 102.898; lower support 92.248. Risk: completed 4H close below 95.798 negates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
