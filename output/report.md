### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 76,200.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 78,890.00 / 81,580.00 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 76,200.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 73,510.00, then a later completed retest and rejection | 70,820.00 / 68,130.00 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 73,510.00 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: no new signal and still range-bound. Bias stays neutral-to-mildly constructive but is softening; latest 4H close eased and quote sits just above 73510, far below 76200, so confirmation is absent. Watch 73510 support, 76200 cap, 70820 downside. Risk: a completed 4H close below 73510 invalidates the lean.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-11 12:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 2,060.00.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: completed 4H close stayed below 2060, keeping failed-reclaim bias intact. Bias remains bearish; current quote has ticked above 2060 intraday, but no completed close or confirmed retest, so it still looks like a probe at resistance. Key levels: 2060 pivot, 2246 upper. Risk: a completed 4H close above 2060 invalidates the bearish view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 4,037.80, then a later completed retest and hold | 4,111.40 / 4,185.00 |

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 3,964.20 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-11-11 00:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 4,037.80.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-11-11 04:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read holds: cautious bullish bias remains unconfirmed and quote is still below the upper pivot. Latest 4H close 4044.53 is above 4037.805, but current quote 4006.495 is below it, so no new signal; action is wait. Key levels: 4037.805 pivot/invalidation, 3964.205 support, 4111.405 upside target. Risk: gap-driven false breakout; a completed 4H close below 4037.805 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-09 20:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 88.03.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right on completed candles, though price is now above 88.031 intraday. Bias stays bearish unless confirmed: latest 4H close 87.331 is below frozen 88.031, but current quote 88.903 shows rebound pressure. Key level is 88.031; below it bearish targets 77.870/67.709 remain relevant. Risk: a completed 4H close above 88.031 invalidates the view; wait for confirmation.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior read was right: support held, tone firm, no new signal. Bias stays neutral-to-firm; latest 4H close 7591.8 and quote 7592.9 are above 7494-7515 support but below 7718.4, so no breakout confirmation. Key levels: 7494-7515 support, 7718.4 breakout threshold, 7367.1 lower pivot. Risk: a 4H close below 7494 weakens tone; rejection at 7718.4 keeps bias neutral.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
