| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 85,431.08 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was mostly right: still rangebound between 83579 and 85431 with bearish bias unconfirmed. Latest 4H close eased and quote is below it, so tone remains soft but not triggered. Key levels: 85431 invalidates bearish bias; 83579 confirms it. Risk: a 4H close above 85431 neutralizes the view; holding above 83579 leaves it unresolved.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 12:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 81,741.00.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Mostly right: price remains below the 84412/84418 cluster and no breakout confirmed. Bias stays modestly bullish, but latest 4H close at 84231 and quote at 84150 show the cluster still caps. Key levels: 84412/84418, then 86265; 81741 is invalidation. Risk: another completed 4H close below 81741 kills the bullish setup, while failure to reclaim cluster keeps rangebound.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH held above 2646.55 and no new signal fired. Bias stays bullish above 2646.55. Latest 4H close 2678.25 and quote 2677.0 show soft consolidation/retest, not breakout confirmation. Key levels: 2646.55 invalidation; upside 2858.50 then 3070.45; lower 2434.60. Risk: completed 4H close below 2646.55 flips view.

Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-23 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price is still holding above 2646 but 4H closes keep stalling near 2690. Bias remains constructive above 2646, though latest close 2679 and quote 2678 show momentum pausing; no 1H confirmation, so chop persists. Watch 2646 as support/invalidation; 2855 and 3064 remain upside markers. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 flips the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral call was right: no confirmation, price still above 4261.375 and below 4341.135. Bias stays neutral. Latest 4H close 4269.94 and quote 4271.58 remain just above support, far below resistance. Key levels: 4261.375 support, 4341.135 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 4261.375 would weaken the range and shift bias bearish; a close above 4341.135 would invalidate neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

Still right: pullback remains above 95.798, though momentum softened further. Bias stays cautiously bullish above the pivot; latest 4H close 96.53 and quote 96.48 show fading upside and unconfirmed retest. Key levels: 95.798 invalidation; upside 99.348 then 102.898; below 95.798 opens 92.248/88.698. Risk: a completed 4H close below 95.798 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
