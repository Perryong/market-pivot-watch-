### Trade levels — conditional plans

|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: still no range confirmation. Bias remains neutral-to-mildly constructive; latest 4H close and quote sit above lower pivot 82874.93 but below upper 84942.45, so price is still range-bound. Key levels: 82874.93 support, 84942.45 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close below 82874.93 would invalidate the constructive tilt.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-10-20 16:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 2,430.00.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-10-20 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH stayed above 2430 with retest intact. Bias remains cautiously bullish; latest 4H close/quote above 2430 confirm pivot hold, but 1H confirmation is still too far and no new signal. Key levels: 2430 invalidation, 2356.79 support, upside 2503.21/2576.42. Risk: completed 4H close below 2430 invalidates; pivot chop can fake confirmation.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-10-20 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 4,140.77.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-10-20 16:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains below 4140.775 and the latest 4H close at 4139.93 is still just under it. Bearish bias holds, but price action is tightening near the pivot, not confirmed downside. Key levels: 4140.775 invalidation, 3981.155 bearish target. Risk is a pivot squeeze; a completed 4H close above 4140.775 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 98.75 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price remains inside 98.753-101.774 with no pivot acceptance. Bias stays neutral; latest 4H close firmed to 100.417 but the quote at 100.059 sits mid-range, so this is still range noise. Watch 98.753 support and 101.774 resistance. Risk is another false band break; decisive 4H acceptance outside either level invalidates neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Events processed this run:
- RETEST_CONFIRMED at 2026-10-21 12:00:00 UTC, close 7,740.20

### AI analysis

The prior constructive read was broadly right, and the retest is now confirmed. Bias stays mildly constructive while holding above 7731, but flat 4H closes show limited momentum. Key support is 7731, deeper 7655.6; upside refs 7806.4 then 7881.8. Risk: a completed 4H close below 7731 invalidates the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
