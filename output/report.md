### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 82,060.88, then a later completed retest and hold | 83,670.58 / 85,280.28 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 82,060.88 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 80,451.18, then a later completed retest and rejection | 78,841.48 / 77,231.78 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 80,451.18 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains inside the frozen range with no confirmed breakout. Bias stays neutral; the latest 4H close held mid-range and the quote is slightly softer, so confirmation is still absent. Key levels are 80451.18 support and 82060.88 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close outside either pivot would invalidate the neutral view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-10-25 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 2,351.55.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-10-25 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: no completed 4H close above 2351.55; latest close 2350.36 and quote 2348.07 remain below it. Bias stays bearish under the lower pivot, with price firming near it but unconfirmed. Key levels: 2351.55 invalidation, 2417.77 upper pivot; bearish targets 2285.33/2219.11. Risk: a completed 4H close above 2351.55 invalidates the bearish view.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 4,021.16 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: neutral held and the latest 4H close edged higher, still inside the pivots. Bias stays neutral; the small 4H rise is mid-range noise and the current quote is slightly softer, so no break or confirmation. Key levels: 4021.17 support, 4126.37 resistance. Risk: a decisive close outside that range would invalidate the neutral view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: neutrality and frozen pivots still hold, with price firmer but still mid-range. Latest 4H close is flat inside the range, so no directional confirmation; bias stays neutral. Key levels remain 103.194 resistance and 99.738 support. A decisive 4H close outside either invalidates neutrality, with a break below support the main risk.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 7,655.60 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-10-28 00:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 7,731.00.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: 7731 still lacks decisive acceptance and price slipped back after the close. Bias stays neutral with a mild bullish tilt, since the completed 4H closed just above 7731 but the live quote is back below, so confirmation/retest is pending. Watch acceptance around 7731 and support at 7655.6. Risk is choppy false breaks; a completed 4H close below 7731 invalidates the bullish tilt.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
