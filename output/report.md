### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price remains inside frozen pivots, so neutral/range bias still holds. Latest 4H close 83389.54 and quote 83468.32 sit above lower 82874.93, below upper 84942.45, showing no confirmed breakout. Key levels: 82874.93 support, 84942.45 resistance. Risk: a 4H close below support or above resistance invalidates range view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH remains above 2646 with retest still unconfirmed. Bias stays bullish-leaning but confirmation is lacking; latest 4H close 2673.5 and quote 2682.39 sit above the 2646 pivot, though the close eased. Watch 2646 as support/invalidation, with upside markers 2855 then 3064 and lower 2436 if it fails. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 flips the bias.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
