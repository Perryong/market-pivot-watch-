### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read still right: range held and neutral bias remains intact. Latest 4H close 84116.8 and quote 84163.35 sit above midpoint ~83909 but below upper 84942, so upper-half range-bound, no confirmed breakout. Key levels: 83909 midpoint, 84942 upper, 82875 lower. Risk is whipsaw; sustained 4H close below midpoint or outside either pivot invalidates neutral.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 2,646.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 2,855.11 / 3,064.22 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 2,646.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 2,436.89, then a later completed retest and rejection | 2,227.78 / 2,018.67 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 2,436.89 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 04:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 2,646.00.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-23 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: ETH held above 2646 and stayed constructive but stalled. Latest 4H close 2691.16 keeps bias constructive above pivot 2646, but price is still stalling and 1H entry waits. Key levels: 2646 invalidation, 2436.89 support, upside 2855.11 then 3064.22. Risk: completed 4H close below 2646 flips bias; no fresh 1H breakout means stall persists.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
