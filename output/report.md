### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Prior read was broadly right: no range confirmation yet. Bias stays neutral-to-mildly constructive; latest 4H close and quote sit above lower pivot 82874.93 but below upper 84942.45, so price remains range-bound pending confirmation. Key levels: 82874.93 support, 84942.45 resistance. Risk: a completed 4H close back below 82874.93 would invalidate the constructive tilt.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 2,430.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 2,503.21 / 2,576.42 |

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 2,356.79 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-10-20 16:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 2,430.00.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-10-20 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH held above 2430 and cautious bullish bias stayed valid. Updated bias stays cautiously bullish; latest 4H close/quote are above 2430 with retest confirmed, though 1H confirmation is still too far. Key levels: 2430 invalidation, 2356.79 support, upside 2503.21/2576.42. Risk: completed 4H close below 2430 invalidates; pivot chop can fake confirmation.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-10-20 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 4,140.77.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-10-20 16:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: current quote 4131.46 remains below 4140.775 and latest completed 4H close is still under pivot. Bearish bias holds, but price action is consolidation, not confirmation. Key levels: 4140.775 invalidation, 3981.155 bearish target. Risk is pivot squeeze/rebound; a completed 4H close above 4140.775 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 98.75 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: price stayed inside 98.753-101.774 and rejected the upper band. Bias remains neutral; latest 4H close softened to 100.244 and the quote sits mid-range, showing no pivot acceptance. Watch 98.753 support and 101.774 resistance. Risk is another false band break; decisive 4H acceptance outside either level invalidates neutrality.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-10-21 00:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 7,731.00.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

That read was broadly right: the 4H close held above 7731 and price has firmed since. Bias remains constructive but unconfirmed, with price above the 7731 pivot and no retest. Key support 7731, deeper 7655.6; upside refs 7806.4 then 7881.8. Risk: a completed 4H close below 7731 invalidates the view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
