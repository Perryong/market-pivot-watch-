No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: range held, bias neutral, no breakout. Updated: still neutral; latest 4H close 78114 and quote 78158 sit mid-range above 76500 and below 81971, showing mild cooling from prior close. Key levels: 77622 near support, 76500 lower pivot, 81971 cap. Risk: a 4H close below 77622 weakens the range view; losing 76500 invalidates it.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### AI analysis

That read was wrong: the completed 4H close fell below 2293.44, invalidating the neutral lean. Bias is now bearish; the latest close below the lower pivot and current quote still under it mean the breakdown lacks a confirmed retest. Watch 2293.44 and 2391.55, with bearish targets 2195.33/2097.22. Risk: a completed 4H close back above 2293.44 invalidates the bearish view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Bias leans bearish: price is well below the frozen lower pivot at 3964.2. The latest 4H close edged higher but failed to reclaim that pivot, and the current quote is back below the close, signaling weak follow-through. Key levels: immediate support/target near 3890.6, then 3817.0; 3964.2 is the pivot hurdle. Risk: a sustained reclaim of 3964.2 would invalidate the bearish read.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: no fresh confirmation, price stayed between pivots. Bias remains bearish but unconfirmed; latest 4H close was flat at 101.927 after the drop, and quote at 101.43 sits nearer support, signaling weak momentum. Key levels: 103.194 neutralization, 99.738 support. Risk: a completed 4H close above 103.194 invalidates the bearish view; session-gap noise can distort signals.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price is still below 7655.6 and the bounce remains unconfirmed. Updated read: bias bearish-to-neutral; latest 4H close 7616.6 and quote 7614.1 are capped under the lower pivot, so upside lacks confirmation. Watch 7655.6 resistance and 7580.2 downside reference; 7731.0 upper pivot. Risk: a completed close above 7655.6 would invalidate the bearish tone.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
