### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 81,971.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,441.89 / 92,912.78 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 81,971.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 76,500.11, then a later completed retest and rejection | 71,029.22 / 65,558.33 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 76,500.11 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-05 16:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 76,500.11.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-11-05 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price stayed below 76500 and no confirmation fired. Bias remains bearish, but latest quote 76191.54 has rebounded toward the 76500 pivot while completed 4H close 75615.55 keeps structure below it; action is wait. Key levels: 76500 invalidation/resistance, downside 71029/65558, upper 81971. Risk: a completed 4H close above 76500 flips view.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right on structure: price remains below 2293.44 despite the bounce. Bias stays bearish; latest 4H close 2228.85 and quote 2244.23 sit under the lower pivot, no retest confirmed. Key levels: 2293.44 invalidation, 2195.33 then 2097.22 bearish targets, 2391.55 upper cap. Risk: a completed 4H close above 2293.44 invalidates; without retest, confirmation is lacking.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 88.03 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: the downward correction continued and no bullish confirmation appeared. Bias stays neutral-to-soft inside the range; the latest 4H close and current quote are lower, still above lower pivot 88.031 and far below upper pivot 98.192. Key levels remain 88.031 and 98.192. Risk: a completed 4H close below 88.031 would invalidate the range/neutral view and signal deeper weakness.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Tracked setup: **SELL**, first confirmed 2026-11-06 08:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close above 7,367.10.
Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: 4H close remains just below 7367.1 while live quote is above, so no sustained break. Bias is neutral-to-soft; the sub-pivot 4H close keeps mild downside pressure, but price is choppy. Watch 7367.1, then 7718.4; losing 7367.1 keeps 7015.8/6664.5 in view. Risk is whipsaw/false break; invalidation is a completed 4H close above 7367.1.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
