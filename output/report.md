### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Neutral/mild-upside call was right: no breakout, price still above midpoint. Bias remains neutral with slight upside tilt; latest 4H close and quote sit just above midpoint, so range persists. Key levels: midpoint ~83909, upper 84942, lower 82875. Risk: whipsaw; sustained 4H close outside either pivot invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 2,646.00, then a later completed retest and hold | 2,855.11 / 3,064.22 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 2,646.00 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 2,436.89, then a later completed retest and rejection | 2,227.78 / 2,018.67 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 2,436.89 after a bearish setup | — |

Tracked setup: **BUY**, first confirmed 2026-09-21 04:00:00 UTC. Invalidation: completed close below 2,646.00.
Retest: confirmed on a later completed bar at 2026-09-23 20:00:00 UTC; this is not a promise of a current fill.

### AI analysis

That read was right: ETH still holds above 2646 and still lacks fresh upside confirmation. Bias constructive but stalled; latest 4H closes 2691-2693 stay above upper pivot yet below breakout. Key levels: 2646 invalidation, upside 2855 then 3064, support 2436.89. Risk: completed 4H close below 2646 flips bias; no new signal yet.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
