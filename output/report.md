### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 84,942.45, then a later completed retest and hold | 87,009.97 / 89,077.49 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 84,942.45 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 82,874.93, then a later completed retest and rejection | 80,807.41 / 78,739.89 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 82,874.93 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous neutral/range read remains correct: price is still inside frozen pivots and no break confirmed. Bias stays neutral. Latest 4H close 83069.99 and current 83280.02 are both above lower pivot 82874.93 but below upper 84942.45, so range conditions persist. Key levels: lower 82874.93, upper 84942.45. Risk: a 4H close below lower or above upper would invalidate neutral and signal a range shift.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

Retest: not yet confirmed on a later completed bar.

### AI analysis

Previous read was right: price still holds above 2646, retest unconfirmed. Bias stays bullish-leaning but unconfirmed; latest 4H close slipped from 2688.71, while quote sits just above pivot. Key levels: 2646 support/invalidation, upside 2855 then 3064, lower 2436. Risk: a completed 4H close below 2646 invalidates the setup.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.

| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 4,140.77 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Previous read largely held: price stayed under 4140.8 and is now drifting back toward 4123. Bias remains mildly bearish below 4140.775; the latest 4H close above prior close is not enough to clear the cap, and current quote has slipped toward support. Key levels: 4140.775 cap, 4123 support. Risk: a 4H close above 4140.775 invalidates the bearish tilt; losing 4123 revives downside risk.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

### Trade levels — conditional plans

| Action | Confirmation / level | T1 / T2 |
|---|---|---|
| Buy entry | New 4H cross above 95.80, then a later completed retest and hold | 99.35 / 102.90 |
| Sell/exit long | Completed 4H close below 95.80 after a bullish setup | — |
| Short entry | New 4H cross below 92.25, then a later completed retest and rejection | 88.70 / 85.15 |
| Buy/exit short | Completed 4H close above 92.25 after a bearish setup | — |

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

That read was right: 95.80 held and price remains above it. Bias stays cautiously bullish above the 95.80 upper pivot; latest 4H close 96.99 and quote near 97.28 keep rebound intact, though no active setup and 1H missed move mean confirmation is still lacking. Key levels: 95.80 support, 92.25 deeper, 99.35 next bullish confirmation. Risk: a decisive close back below 95.80 invalidates.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.

No tracked active setup. Price state alone does not establish a new entry.

### AI analysis

Read still correct: no pivot break, tone stayed neutral-to-soft. Latest 4H close 7678.8 remains above 7655.6; quote 7674.6 sits just below that close, so bias is neutral-to-soft. Key levels: 7655.6 support, 7731.0 resistance. Risk: decisive 4H close below 7655.6 invalidates soft tilt; above 7731.0 shifts tone.


Strategy: completed 4H pivot breakout plus a later completed retest; targets project one and two range widths. Breakout signals ignore active candles and intrabar wicks. Retest touches use the range of a later finished candle.
Selling an existing long and opening a short are different actions. Targets are conditional; closed-bar invalidation is not a guaranteed stop-loss fill.
